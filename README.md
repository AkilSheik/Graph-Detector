This is an ongoing project continuing to be developed. Given a desmos graph PNG image as input, it would predict an equation for the graph. I used Selenium and Desmos to take snapshots of graphs containing trigonometric, exponential, rational, and polynomial functions. 
Aim is to use image processing techniques and computer vision to classify each of these graphs based on the functions they contain. 

For instance, given an input of a graph of x^2 + cos(x), the aim is for the model to recognize that this consists of a quadratic and cosine function added together.
