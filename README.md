This is an ongoing project continuing to be developed. Given a desmos graph PNG image as input, goal is to predict an equation for the graph. I used Selenium and Desmos API to take snapshots of graphs containing trigonometric, exponential, rational, and polynomial functions. 
Aim is to use image processing techniques to classify each of these graphs based on the functions they contain.
